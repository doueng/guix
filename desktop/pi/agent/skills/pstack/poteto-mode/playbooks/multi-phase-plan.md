### Multi-phase or multi-PR plan

**You own the plan, not the code. The plan is a checklist an owner runs box by box and the operator audits from the evidence.** The plan is the deliverable. Do not implement.

1. When the change is one or two files with an obvious approach, skip the plan. Say so and stop.
2. Settle open questions by prototype before you write. Run `playbooks/prototype.md` for each. Keep the branch, the SHA, and the screenshots for Appendix A. Ask the operator only about a product or preference call that no run can settle. Give options (the **never-block-on-the-human** principle skill).
3. Explore disjoint areas through an available local delegation workflow. Otherwise inspect them sequentially. Keep reports to file pointers, conventions, test commands, and entry points.
4. Copy the skeleton below into the plan file and fill every placeholder. Unless the operator names a path, write the file under the agent store's `docs/`. Keep every heading and every sub-block in the order shown. One section per PR. One PR is one change with its own evidence (the **sequence-verifiable-units** principle skill). Name the execution playbook in **How to read this**. Pick between `playbooks/autopilot-full.md` and `playbooks/autopilot-stack.md` per the rule at the end of `playbooks/autopilot-stack.md`. A standing program takes `playbooks/orchestrate.md`.
5. Write under `/technical-writing` in full, then `/unslop`. The body is one Diátaxis mode, how-to. Appendices hold explanation and reference. Each heading states the task or the finding. No long dashes. No mid-sentence colons.
6. Resolve the installed poteto-mode directory from the skill location. Run `node <poteto-mode-directory>/scripts/check-plan.mjs <plan.md>` and fix every line it prints (the **encode-lessons-in-structure** principle skill).
7. Hand back. Post the plan path and the script's output, then stop. Execution starts on the operator's explicit go, under the execution playbook the plan names.

**Verification.** Tests alone are not sufficient verification. A PR is verified only when its unit, live, and perf boxes are all checked (the **prove-it-works** principle skill). That sentence is the verification rule. Every verification block opens with it. The live block is mandatory. Each independent lane drives the real surface through an available control skill or a named driver. Each lane is one box with a concrete scenario, its evidence, and its pass predicate. If independent lanes cannot be run in the active Pi session, record that gap instead of presenting self-review as independent coverage. One lane is the **Regression lane against trunk.** It runs the same load-bearing scenario on trunk and head. If trunk does not have the feature, the lane records that fact and gates the behavior the diff adds plus the end state the user waits for instead of inventing a trunk result. The perf gate is dual-sided. Trunk and head must both produce the named metric. If trunk lacks the feature, also isolate the work the diff adds and set an absolute budget for that work plus the end-to-end state the user waits for. Do not claim a ratio between unlike scenarios. The perf block names the metric, the interleaved probe, the trunk baseline measured first, and the rule with the number that fails. A PR that changes an interaction is review-gated. The operator reviews it in chat with screenshots and a video before merge. A PR that changes no interaction writes `**Review gate.** None. <PR id> is not review-gated.` and no boxes under it.

**Control skill.** Pick an installed control skill by surface. If none exists, name the concrete driver available for the browser, desktop app, CLI, TUI, or service. A PR that touches two surfaces gets coverage for both. A surface without a usable driver is an explicit verification gap.

# <Program> plan

<Under ten lines. What changes, for whom, the rule the program enforces, and the PR ids in order.>

## How to read this

One box is one unit of work. Every box names the evidence that checks it. A nested box is a sub-step of the box above it. Check a box only when its evidence exists, a file, a log line, a screenshot, a test run, or a SHA. The body is a how-to. The appendices explain and record.

The program runs `playbooks/<execution playbook>.md` relative to the installed poteto-mode directory. <Who merges, and which PR ids are the operator's items that stop at merge-ready.>

Tests alone are not sufficient verification. A PR is verified only when its unit, live, and perf boxes are all checked.

## Program checklist

### Arm the program

- [ ] State the protocol and this plan to the operator, then stop. Start execution only on the operator's explicit go.
- [ ] On the operator's go, record the plan path, PR order, verification rule, merge owner, and done condition in the decision trail.
- [ ] Read the installed workflows at program start. Record their resolved paths in the decision trail and re-read them at every tick. Resolve bundled paths relative to the poteto-mode directory. Do not assume the target repository contains the personal skill bundle.
  - [ ] `playbooks/<execution playbook>.md`
  - [ ] `../swarm/SKILL.md`
  - [ ] `<resolved control skill path>`
  - [ ] `playbooks/opening-a-pr.md`
  - [ ] `../<each other leaf skill the program uses>/SKILL.md`
- [ ] If the active Pi session supports background monitoring, arm an hourly audit tick. Otherwise state that unattended monitoring is unavailable and do not imply the plan will continue after the session ends.
- [ ] Each audit checks the active playbook, verifies progress from side effects, records drift and blockers, and appends a decision-trail row. Do not claim a watcher or replacement agent exists unless it is available in the active Pi session.
- [ ] On the operator's hold or stand-down, send every owner a zero-writes order at once.

### Spawn owners

- [ ] Spawn one owner per PR with the full lifecycle the execution playbook names.
- [ ] Follow this dependency graph. Start dependent work only after its parent merges, or base it on the parent branch when the execution playbook stacks.
  - [ ] <PR id> and <PR id> are independent and first. Both branch from `main`.
  - [ ] <PR id> after <PR id>.
- [ ] Hold the file boundaries. <PR id or class> touches only `<glob>`.
- [ ] Hold the review gate. <PR ids> change an interaction. They wait for the operator's review in chat with screenshots and a video before merge.

### PR mechanics, for every PR

- [ ] Resolve the forge once. Default to `gh`; if `command -v origin` succeeds and Origin can resolve the repository, use `origin pr` for every PR operation. Record any fallback to `gh`. Never require `gt`.
- [ ] Open the PR ready, never draft, per **Opening a PR**. Use the run's built-in PR tool when it has one, else `origin pr create --status open --base <base-branch>` or `gh pr create --base <base-branch>` according to the resolved forge. A stack child targets its parent branch.
- [ ] Run the repo's lint and typecheck once before the PR-facing push. Push with hooks on.
- [ ] Run available formatting and lint checks before each commit and `/no-comments` before review.
- [ ] Triage every Bugbot and security-reviewer comment per `../references/bugbot-triage.md`.
- [ ] Rebase onto current trunk before the code-ready report and babysit. Keep that merge base in fix rounds. Rebase again only at merge prep, on a `git merge-tree` conflict with trunk, or on a CI failure that comes from a change on trunk.

### Verdict and merge, for every PR

- [ ] Verify the exact code-ready head SHA and each later changed head. Run available checks and live verification for every affected product surface. Add independent review lanes when the active Pi session supports them. Record unavailable verification as a gap, not a pass.
- [ ] Clean only when every lane is `PASS`. Findings go back to the owner, including a defect that a lane filed as a note. A new head gets a fresh swarm and a fresh verdict, except for results that stay valid under the patch-id rule in `playbooks/shipping.md`.
- [ ] <The merge or append rule from the execution playbook, with the patch-id rule from `playbooks/shipping.md`.>

### Boot recipe, for every live lane

Each live lane verifies the real surface at the PR head. Use an installed control skill when available; otherwise name and run the concrete driver.

- [ ] `git fetch origin <head-branch> && git checkout <head SHA>`.
- [ ] <Start the backend and the surface. Wait for ready.>
- [ ] <Deliver input only through the control skill's commands. Name the read-only diagnostics.>
- [ ] Save verification evidence to a named path and return it with the report.

## <Task as a verb phrase> (<PR id>)

**Depends on.** <PR id, or None.>

**Files.**

- [ ] Edit `<path>`.
- [ ] Create `<path>`.
- [ ] Delete `<path>`.

**Build.**

- [ ] <One change. Name the symbol and the file.>

**You see.**

- [ ] <One observable result, with the exact log line or screen state.>

**Verify, unit.** Tests alone are not sufficient verification. A PR is verified only when its unit, live, and perf boxes are all checked.

- [ ] <Test file and the case it gains.> Run `<command>`.

**Verify, live.** Tests alone are not sufficient verification. A PR is verified only when its unit, live, and perf boxes are all checked. Cover each affected user-facing surface with a real scenario and record untestable surfaces as gaps.

- [ ] Lane 1. <Real user scenario.> Evidence `<path>`. Pass when <observable predicate>.
- [ ] Lane 2. <Independent scenario or review.> Evidence `<path>`. Pass when <observable predicate>.

**Verify, perf.** Tests alone are not sufficient verification. A PR is verified only when its unit, live, and perf boxes are all checked.

- [ ] Metric. <What is measured at both trunk and head. If trunk lacks the feature, also name the diff-added work and the end-to-end state the user waits for.>
- [ ] Probe. <The command or procedure, run at trunk and at the head, interleaved. Both sides must produce the metric.>
- [ ] Baseline. Record the trunk <value> first.
- [ ] Rule. <Head against trunk, with the number that fails. If the scenarios differ, add absolute budgets for the diff-added work and the user-visible end state instead of an invalid ratio.>

**Review gate.** The operator reviews before merge.

- [ ] Copy lane <n> screenshots into `<media path>/<pr-id>-review-<slug>.png`.
- [ ] Record a 30 to 60 second video of the change on a lane VM. Save it as `<media path>/<pr-id>-review.mp4`.
- [ ] Post the screenshots and the video in chat. Stop at merge-ready. Wait for the operator's click.

**Merge.**

- [ ] Root's clean verdict at the exact head SHA.
- [ ] Bugbot triage done.
- [ ] Rebased onto current trunk after the verdict, patch-id unchanged.
- [ ] <The owner squash-merges its own PR, or the root appends it to the base-branch stack and the operator lands it bottom-up.>

## Close the program

- [ ] Every box above is checked with its evidence.
- [ ] Reply to the operator with the report the execution playbook names.

## Appendix A. Prototype evidence

<Each open question a prototype answered, with the branch, the SHA, and the artifact links. Each question that stays unproven.>

## Appendix B. Alternatives rejected

<Each approach weighed and why it lost.>

## Appendix C. Risks

<Each risk with the PR it lands in and what the owner watches.>

## Appendix D. Links and reading list

<Docs to read before editing. Which PRs get the installed how and interrogate skills. The trail follows the installed show-me-your-work skill. Record every resolved skill path.>
